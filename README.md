## Matthew's Todo App

https://a4-fatalcodes.onrender.com

For this assignment, I implemented my project from A3 but this time using React components, the Mantine UI library, Express, MongoDB, and Passport GitHub authentication. The app still functions almost identically to A3, but the UI is a little different now and you can login/logout with a GitHub account.
